üéØ Breast Cancer Prediction using scikit-learn

In this repository, I have implemented a breast cancer prediction model using the scikit-learn machine learning library. The project utilizes the famous Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset from scikit-learn's built-in datasets. The main goal is to accurately classify tumors as either benign or malignant based on various features extracted from medical images.

üîç Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Performed data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature scaling to ensure data quality.
Model Selection: Utilized popular machine learning algorithms such as SVM, Logistic Regression, and Decision Trees to compare their performance.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess their predictive performance.
Model Deployment: Deployed the best-performing model using Flask to create a simple web application for breast cancer prediction.

üöÄ Results:
The breast cancer prediction model achieved an impressive accuracy of 97% on the test dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in aiding medical professionals in diagnosing breast tumors. The project showcases the power of scikit-learn and its ease of integration with web frameworks for practical use.
