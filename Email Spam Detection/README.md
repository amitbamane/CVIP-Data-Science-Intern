🔎 Kaggle Spam vs. Ham Message Detection 🔍

🚀 In this repository, I have implemented a powerful SMS message classification system using diverse classification models. The project allows you to delve into the intriguing realm of SMS message classification! 📲💬
📊 The main goal is to accurately classify messages as either spam or ham based on various features extracted from messages.

💡 Key Features:
📋 Data Preprocessing: Performed data cleaning, handled missing values, lowercased text, and applied vectorization to ensure data quality.
🤖 Model Selection: Utilized popular machine learning algorithms like SVM, Logistic Regression, and Decision Trees to compare their performance.
📈 Model Evaluation: Evaluated the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess their predictive performance.

🎉 Results: The Spam vs. Ham Message Detection model achieved an impressive accuracy of 99% on the test dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying messages into spam and ham categories. 🎯📝
🌟 The project showcases the power of vectorization, converting input data from its raw text format into numerical vectors. This transformation is the format that ML models support, contributing to the exceptional classification accuracy. 📈🔍
