Speech Emotion Recognition using LSTM - Project  ðŸš€

Welcome to the repository for my exciting Internship project at CodersCave, where I have implemented a state-of-the-art Speech Emotion Recognition system on the CREMA-D dataset. This project showcases the power of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models in understanding and classifying emotions within speech data.

Project Overview ðŸŽ¯
In this project, I delved into the fascinating realm of speech analysis, aiming to accurately recognize and classify emotions embedded within speech recordings. Leveraging the CREMA-D dataset, I employed advanced machine learning techniques to achieve impressive results in emotional classification.

Key Features ðŸŒŸ
Data Preprocessing: To ensure robust results, I took a novel approach to data cleaning. I created a well-structured dataframe that contains emotion labels by extracting them from the corresponding file names. This meticulous preprocessing was crucial for accurate model training.
Model Selection: I harnessed the power of LSTM models for their ability to capture temporal dependencies in data. The LSTM architecture allowed me to effectively classify emotions in speech recordings, creating a versatile system capable of understanding nuanced expressions.
Model Evaluation: Rigorous evaluation is the cornerstone of model development. I thoroughly assessed the LSTM model's performance using essential metrics like accuracy, providing a clear understanding of its predictive capabilities.

Results ðŸš€
The Speech Emotion Recognition LSTM model achieved a remarkable accuracy of 0.8542 on the training dataset and an equally impressive 0.5436241626739502% on the test dataset. These results underscore the efficacy of the LSTM model in deciphering complex emotional patterns within speech data. The success of this project underscores the immense potential of LSTM models in real-world applications.

Additional Note: The final trained LSTM model has been saved in an h5 file for further use, ensuring that the valuable work can be seamlessly integrated into future projects.
